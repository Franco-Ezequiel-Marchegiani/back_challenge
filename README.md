# How to set up this project?

Make sure to install all dependencies and install "npm" in your folder along with the files.


## Execution Scripts: 
Once you have everything installed and configured, access to the "src", put the folders and files inside, and then run the next command:

### Command Order:

- node app.js

### Explanation:

First, we access the "src" folder to run the "app.js", which is located inside that folder.

And once this is done, there'll be a message in the console saying:

**Server running on port: 5056** 
(Change the number of the port as desired; by default, the project runs on port No. 5056)
